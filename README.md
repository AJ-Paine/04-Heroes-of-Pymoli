# Heroes-of-Pymoli
Pandas Challenge

This repository was created for DU Data Analytics Bootcamp homework on working with datasets using Pandas

In this challenge I use Jupyter Notebooks for the first time to analyze a dataset containing user and purchasing info for a fantasy game "Heros of Pymoli".
The script will use several Pandas functions including groupby, cut, mean, sum, nunique, and others to provide analysis on gender and age demographics.  
It will also identify the top spenders, most popular items and most profitable items.
