# Heroes-of-Pymoli

In this project I use Jupyter Notebooks for the first time to analyze a dataset containing user and purchasing info for a fantasy game "Heros of Pymoli".
The script will use several Pandas functions including groupby, cut, sort, mean, sum, nunique, and others to provide analysis on gender and age demographics.  
It will also identify the top spenders, most popular items, most profitable items, and summary table of purchases made within the game.
